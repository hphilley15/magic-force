# Shuffle element in an Array

Implement a function my_shuffle that moves the elements in an array into a random order.

``` python
arr = [1,2,3,4]
my_shuffle( arr ) -> [2,4,3,1], [2,3,1,4], ...

def my_shuffle( arr ):
    ...
```

Do not use itertools or similar libraries, but try and implement the suffle by yourself.
